# Hello Hello!
I'm a programmer that loves to build easy to use yet desceptivily powerful tools. I'm currently working on 
Rradlr, a programming language toolkit, and Rum, a stealth programming language. I'll ocassionally tinker in game and web development, and got some
repos around here that focuses on those.
