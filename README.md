# Hello Hello!
I'm a developer that loves to build simple yet desceptivily powerful tools. I'm currently working on 
Hydrocarbon, a programming language toolkit. I'll ocassionally tinker in game and web development, and got some
repos around here that focuses on those. 

When not programming I'm spending time with my two little boys, cooking, pencil sketching, or trying in vain to compose a musical
masterpiece.
