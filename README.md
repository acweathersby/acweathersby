# Hello Hello!
I'm a programmer that loves to build easy to use yet desceptivily powerful tools. I'm currently working on 
Sherpa, a programming language toolkit. I'll ocassionally tinker in game and web development, and got some
repos around here that focuses on those. 

When not programming I'm spending time with my kids, cooking, pencil sketching, or trying in vain to master the piano.
